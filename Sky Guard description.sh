# Technical Architecture

echo "
Sky Guard is built on a robust and scalable architecture, leveraging modern technologies and frameworks to deliver a seamless and high-performance user experience.

1. Backend: The backend is developed using Python and Flask, with Flask-SQLAlchemy for database interactions and Flask-Migrate for database migrations.
2. Machine Learning: Utilizes scikit-learn and other machine learning libraries for predictive maintenance models.
3. Database: Employs a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) to store user data, maintenance records, compliance logs, and fleet information.
4. Front-End: Although primarily a backend-focused project, Sky Guard integrates with front-end dashboards using Flask templates or can be paired with a separate front-end framework like React or Angular for enhanced interactivity.
5. APIs: Provides RESTful APIs for all major functionalities, enabling easy integration with other systems and platforms.
6. Notifications: Integrates with Flask-Mail for email notifications and Twilio API for SMS alerts.
7. Data Visualization: Uses matplotlib for generating visual analytics and charts.
